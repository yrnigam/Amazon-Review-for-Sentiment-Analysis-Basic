# Amazon-Review-for-Sentiment-Analysis-Lexicon-Based
Sentiment analysis uses a process to computationally determine whether a piece of writing is positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Amazon Comprehend is a natural language processing (NLP) text analytics service made up of a handful of APIs that allows you to detect sentiment (along with key phrases, named entities, and language) and perform topic modeling from a collection of documents.
In Lexicon-based sentiment analysis we count number of positive and negative words in given text and the larger count will be the sentiment of text.
